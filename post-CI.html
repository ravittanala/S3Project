Continuous integration
<h2>----------------------------------------</h2>
</h1>
<h3>Continuous integration is a process for frequently building and testing new code changes.</h3> 
<h3>Generally, code is hosted on a central repository, like Git, that is monitoring by a CI service.</h3> 
<h3>When changes are detected, the CI service will pull and build the new code.</h3>

<h3>> Ensures that code can be built and executed</h3>
<h3>> Requires that all unit tests are passing</h3>
<h3>> Immediately alerts developers of build failures.</h3>
